"keep your person close, even from miles away"

A project for Technica 2025. Chrome extension that lets long-distance couples send tiny affectionate “pings,” love notes, status updates, or little floating ghosts across the screen. 

Core Idea

Gravestone icon is always visible in the Chrome extension.

  Single-click interaction:
    - On one user’s computer, clicking the gravestone triggers ghost animation on the other user’s screen (shake + glow).
    - After the ghost responds, the user can open their menu.

  Menu Options (4 icons)
    1. Letter icon – Mailbox: Receive/send messages. Pending mail is indicated visually. Ghost floats out to deliver the message
    2. Spider bow icon – Dressing Station: Change the ghost’s appearance (clothes, hats, glasses, etc.).
    3. Wand icon – Mail Gifts: Send virtual gifts (can animate with ghost flying).
    4. Skull icon – Haunt: Ghost chases the other user’s mouse. Plays scary sounds and shows messages.

  Additional Features
    Pending Mail Indicator – Visual cue when messages are waiting.
    Ghost Animations – Shake, glow, float, chase mouse.
    Sound Effects – For haunt and ghost interactions.
