## "Keep Your Person Close, Even From Miles Away"

A project for **Technica 2025**: a Chrome extension that lets long-distance couples send tiny affectionate “pings,” love notes, status updates, or little floating ghosts across the screen.

## Core Idea

The **gravestone icon** is always visible in the Chrome extension.  

**Single-click interaction:**  
- On one user’s computer, clicking the gravestone triggers a ghost animation on the other user’s screen (shake + glow).  
- After the ghost responds, the user can open their menu.

## Menu Options (4 icons)

1. **Letter icon – Mailbox**: Receive/send messages. Pending mail is indicated visually. Ghost floats out to deliver the message.  
2. **Spider bow icon – Dressing Station**: Change the ghost’s appearance (clothes, hats, glasses, etc.).  
3. **Gift icon – Mail Gifts**: Send virtual gifts (can animate with ghost flying).  
4. **Skull icon – Haunt**: Ghost chases the other user’s mouse. Plays scary sounds and shows messages.
