# justABooAway

"keep your person close, even from miles away"

A project for Technica 2025. Chrome extension that lets long-distance couples send tiny affectionate “pings,” love notes, status updates, or little floating ghosts/cats across the screen. Users can choose between a ghost or a cat based on their preference.


Some planned features:
  - Send a quick “boo!” or “meow!” notification to your partner
  - Floating animated cat/ghost pops onto their screen
  - Quick love notes
  - Mood slider (“thinking of you”, “busy but love you”, “come back pls”)
  - Custom sound effects (send a quick message to your partner)
